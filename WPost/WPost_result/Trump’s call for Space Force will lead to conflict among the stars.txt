By Letters to the Editor     March 8  Regarding Vice President Pence’s March 3 op-ed, “America needs a Space Force”: President Trump’s proposal to create a Space Force is a clarion call for future wars in space. Rival countries with missile capabilities, such as China, India and Iran, will follow the U.S. example and launch anti-satellite weapons into Earth’s orbit. Space conflicts could create copious collisions between satellites and anti-satellite interceptors. These collisions could produce enormous amounts of space debris accumulating at a geometric rate, much like a nuclear chain reaction. The resulting space trash could impede future launches for space exploration and anti-asteroid defenses. Frank Richter, Clawson, Mich.
