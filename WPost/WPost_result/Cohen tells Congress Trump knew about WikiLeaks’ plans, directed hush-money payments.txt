Michael Cohen, Trump’s former fixer and personal lawyer, cast the president as a mendacious and petty racist who enlisted those around him to propagate a culture of deceit, in business, during his campaign and after winning the White House. In testimony before the House Oversight Committee, Cohen revealed how, in his view, Trump broke the law even as president, and he suggested ominously that federal prosecutors remain interested in a case involving the president. “Is there any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven’t yet discussed today?” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) asked. “Yes, and again, those are part of the investigation that’s currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York,” Cohen responded. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment. Cohen hinted repeatedly at possible legal jeopardy for the president, saying he was willing to tell all now out of fear that if Trump were to lose the 2020 election, “there will never be a peaceful transition of power.”    Michael Cohen testifies before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Feb. 27, 2019.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  “My loyalty to Mr. Trump has cost me everything,” Cohen said. “I will not sit back, say nothing and allow him to do the same to the country.” Some of Cohen’s claims were backed by evidence, while others will hinge on his admittedly poor track record for reliability. Cohen is facing a three-year prison sentence that is scheduled to begin in May, in part for having lied previously to Congress. The president and his Republican allies sought to portray Cohen as a fabulist, disgruntled because Trump wouldn’t give him a job in the White House and now hoping to get rich with a possible movie or book deal arising from specious claims about the president and those closest to him. “You’re a pathological liar. You don’t know truth from falsehood,” said Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.), who also jeered Cohen with the schoolyard chant “liar, liar pants on fire.” “No one should ever listen to you and give you credibility,” he added.       1 of 22
