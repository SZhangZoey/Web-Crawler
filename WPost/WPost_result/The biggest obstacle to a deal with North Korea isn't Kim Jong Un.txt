His work focuses on U.S.-Korea relations and U.S. Foreign Policy.   February 25    President Trump is set to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un this week in Vietnam. While the complexities of the North Korean nuclear issue and Pyongyang’s well-recorded history of hard bargaining present challenges for an accord, the biggest obstacle to a deal may be the American foreign policy establishment. When confronted by an unorthodox president intent on challenging its deeply held beliefs or institutional prerogatives, the foreign policy establishment, a bipartisan power base located inside and outside government, never hesitates to assert itself. If Trump hasn’t learned this, and the danger it poses to his policy, all he needs to do is ask Jimmy Carter. Carter, like Trump, was an outsider, less beholden to establishment thinking and institutions than most presidents. When he controversially tried to withdraw all remaining U.S. ground combat forces from South Korea in 1977, he faced immediate pushback from establishment defenders. They alerted Congress and the public to the dangers of this policy and used their institutional perches and professional knowledge to torpedo it. The same threatens to happen to Trump’s efforts to forge rapprochement, or even a peace treaty, with North Korea. Carter’s policy was under siege from the moment he announced it. In the words of one Pentagon dissenter, his opponents began a “rear-guard action — delay it, water it down, mitigate the decision as much as possible.”  In some instances, their obstruction was overt. For example, Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, chief of staff and third in command of the United States Forces Korea, caused a minor uproar when he told a Washington Post reporter that Carter’s policy would “lead to war.” Carter publicly reprimanded him and removed the general from his post in Korea. But Singlaub wouldn’t back down, providing similar testimony to a subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. Less forceful but arguably more damaging was testimony provided to the same subcommittee by Gen. George S. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Brown said Carter’s policy “went against the chiefs in a fundamental way,” that they had been offered no clear rationale for the policy and had recommended only a phased, partial reduction of just 7,000 troops out of roughly 40,000 over five years, which Carter dismissed. Carter wanted to remove an entire 26,000-person division — all ground combat forces. Buttressing such public testimony, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee received closed-door briefings from CIA officers, who offered more worrisome intelligence on Pyongyang’s military capabilities than administration officials had provided. It also didn’t help that the Pentagon released top-secret, back-channel cables that clearly emphasized the chain-of-command’s concerns about the withdrawal. This push proved successful. Public and internal opposition forced Carter to include a massive, military transfer package of nearly $2 billion and to backload the withdrawal schedule, leaving the bulk of the American troops in South Korea until the third and final phase of the withdrawal. It also compelled Carter to constantly reaffirm Washington’s commitment to Seoul’s security and offer assurances it wouldn’t allow the withdrawal to undermine the military balance on the Korean Peninsula. These promises as good as killed the withdrawal. Congress had to approve funding for the military package and thus possessed a sort of legislative veto. Support from the Joint Chiefs also depended on the package, and without it, Carter would undermine his own rhetorical guarantees. Perhaps counterintuitively, South Korea’s own bad behavior — in this case an illicit influence-buying campaign in the United States — actually helped kill Carter’s plans. It soured congressional attitudes toward Seoul, bolstering the contingent in Congress that was already working to stall the military aid package (a motley group of opponents of withdrawal and opponents of any aid to the then-authoritarian government in Seoul). By April 1978, Carter was forced to draw out and reduce the size of the first phase of the withdrawal. Meanwhile, more ominous intelligence surfaced and was leaked to Congress and the press, indicating North Korea possessed larger and more offensively deployed military forces than originally thought. Although Carter later doubted the veracity of the intelligence, its emergence doomed his policy. He lost his last congressional allies among Democratic centrists, whose support was essential to Carter’s plan. The new intelligence might not even have been necessary. Richard Holbrooke, then assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and one of the chief architects of the internal revolt, recalled, “If the bean counting had gone the other way, we still would have found a reason to suspend the withdrawal.” By July 1979, Carter’s withdrawal policy had been dropped. Trump has faced a similar trajectory for his own Korea policy. There was considerable hand-wringing when he traded bellicose rhetorical broadsides with Kim and threatened the nuclear destruction of North Korea. Yet there was just as much pushback after Trump suddenly reversed course and met with Kim in June. The meeting was maligned: it was rushed and lacked proper working-level preparation; produced a poorly recycled version of past declarations that was short on details; and provided a tyrant international legitimacy, thus forgoing a bargaining chip long-sought by the Kim family regime. The newly appointed ambassador to South Korea, Adm. Harry B Harris, undermined Trump’s policy by testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that North Korea still posed a threat. CIA Director Gina Haspel echoed this point, voicing skepticism Pyongyang would ever relinquish its nuclear arms, as did Trump’s own national security adviser, John Bolton. Democrats, of course, piled on, criticizing Trump’s willingness to rush ahead and make concessions based on “mere hope” and “vague promises.”  Establishment criticism has persisted, including a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies that Pyongyang continued to improve its missile capabilities. Even as Trump prepares to meet with Kim again, his own administration is actively undermining his policy. In recent Senate testimony, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coates acknowledged North Korea’s moratorium on missile and nuclear tests and declared support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, but added Pyongyang had only “reversibly dismantled portions of its WMD infrastructure.” The recent Worldwide Threat Assessment more bluntly concluded, “North Korea is unlikely to give up all of its nuclear weapons and production capabilities, even as it seeks to negotiate partial denuclearization steps to obtain key U.S. and international concessions. … North Korean leaders view nuclear arms as critical to regime survival.”  This type of rhetoric is a direct attempt by the intelligence community to limit Trump’s options, making it a long shot that Trump will achieve a genuine denuclearization process — even if the North Koreans acceded to one. Skeptics will have numerous opportunities to derail the policy, and since it won't occur in a vacuum, North Korean actions or other developments in the region could also be obstacles. And there is the problem of Trump himself. Denuclearization requires a grasp of the complexities involved and a willingness to refrain from touting unrealistic expectations. Trump lacks these qualities, and his challenges at home will distract from the laser-focus such a process would demand. If Trump instead tries to forge a new political relationship with North Korea without clear, verifiable denuclearization, he will face even more daunting obstacles. Trump’s envoy to North Korea recently hinted at going in this direction, declaring Trump was “not seeking to topple the North Korean regime.” Instead, American plans for denuclearization need to proceed “alongside” diplomacy because the issue was “bigger than denuclearization, while it stands on the foundation of denuclearization, but that’s the opportunity we have and those are the discussions we will be having with the North Koreans.”  As the summit approaches, reports have emerged that the Trump administration may seek to open a liaison office in North Korea. Although it’s not the first time such a proposition will have been made, it would be a first if actually implemented. Alongside Trump’s recent statement that he is “in no rush” on North Korean denuclearization — as long as Pyongyang refrains from further nuclear and missile tests — it seems a move toward improved political relations without tangible progress on denuclearization is entirely plausible. Recent reports even surfaced that Trump might be considering a peace treaty with the North Koreans. But the establishment will do its best to stop any new relationship with a nuclear North Korea. And as they proved to Carter, for as much power as a president has in foreign policy, when he takes on the establishment, he is likely to lose.
